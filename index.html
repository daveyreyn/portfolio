	<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>I am a Computer Science student at BYU from Los Angeles, California</p>
	<h2>Projects</h2>
		<p>I am relatively new to computer science, having dedicated much of my time
			and academic studies to the field of music composition and theory, so I
			have no projects to show aside from my academic coursework at this time.</p>
		<h2>Experience</h2>
 <ul>
 		<li>Guitar and piano teacher at Miles Ahead Music in American Fork, Utah</li>
		<li>Semi-professional jazz guitarist in Salt Lake City, Utah</li>
</ul>
